## üìÇ Structure

- **`demos/`**  
  Short, focused examples that show how to use the SP-API SDK for specific operations.  
  - Ideal if you want a quick code reference or ‚Äúhello world‚Äù‚Äìstyle snippet.  
  - Example: calling `getOrders` with the SDK in Python.

- **`tutorials/`**  
  Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks that guide you through individual workflows.  
  - Ideal if you want to learn and test one API domain in detail.  
  - Example: querying with the Data Kiosk API.

- **`workshops/`**  
  End-to-end labs that combine multiple APIs to solve a real-world problem.  
  - Ideal for deeper learning or group workshops.  
  - Example: diagnosing listing errors, or building a fulfillment solution with Buy Shipping + MLI.
