# 📖 SP-API Tutorials

This folder contains **step-by-step Jupyter notebooks** that guide you through individual SP-API workflows.  
Tutorials are designed to help you focus on a single API domain at a time, with clear instructions, examples, and sample payloads.

## 🧑‍💻 What Are Tutorials?

- **Goal-oriented** → each tutorial solves one specific SP-API use case.  
- **Guided learning** → notebooks explain concepts as you go, with code cells ready to run.  
- **Hands-on** → you can test real or mock calls and validate outputs.
